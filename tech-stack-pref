# Coach Fitness App Tech Stack Documentation

The preferred tech stack for the Coach fitness app and Figma component migration.

You are permitted to expand upon it with new tools, but you can't replace any of these without first getting explicit permission.

For anything not explicitly outlined, always prefer built-in Expo solutions.

## Frontend

### Core

- React Native via Expo SDK 53 (already configured)
- TypeScript (already configured)
- EAS Build for deployment

### Data Flow & State

- Zustand v5.0.8 for state management (current setup)
- AsyncStorage for data persistence (React Native local storage)
- React Hook Form v7.62.0 for form state management

### Navigation

- Expo Router (file-based routing, current setup)
- React Navigation v7.x (underlying navigation system)
- Expo Linking for deep linking (if needed)

### UI, Styling, & Interactivity

- NativeWind v4.1.23 for styling approach (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
- React Native Reanimated v3.17.4 for animations
- React Native Gesture Handler for touch interactions
- Lucide React Native v0.540.0 for consistent iconography
- Expo Haptics for tactile feedback
- Custom component library (migrated from shadcn/ui)

### Networking

- Fetch API for HTTP requests
- React Native's built-in networking

### Data Storage

- AsyncStorage for local app data and preferences
- Zustand persistence middleware for state hydration

### Testing

- Jest v29.7.0 for unit testing (current setup)
- React Testing Library v13.3.1 for component testing
- Detox v20.40.2 for E2E testing
- Visual regression testing for component migration

### Migration-Specific Tools

- react-native-toast-message (replacement for sonner)
- React Native Modal (replacement for web dialogs)
- React Native Picker (replacement for web select elements)
- Custom implementations for complex shadcn/ui components

## Component Migration Strategy

### Preferred React Native Equivalents

- `View` instead of `div`
- `Text` instead of `span`, `p`, `h1-h6`
- `TextInput` instead of `input`
- `Pressable` instead of `button`
- `ScrollView` instead of scrollable `div`
- `FlatList`/`SectionList` for large lists instead of map rendering
- `Modal` instead of web modals/dialogs

### Styling Approach

- **Primary**: NativeWind classes (maintain Tailwind compatibility)
- **Secondary**: StyleSheet for complex native-specific styling
- **Avoid**: Inline styles except for dynamic values

### State Management Patterns

- **Global State**: Zustand stores with AsyncStorage persistence
- **Form State**: React Hook Form with custom validation
- **Component State**: React useState for local component state
- **Server State**: Built-in fetch with Zustand for caching

### Animation Preferences

- **Primary**: React Native Reanimated v3 for performant animations
- **Secondary**: React Native's built-in Animated API for simple animations
- **Avoid**: CSS-based animations (not available in React Native)

## Key Migration Principles

1. **Maintain Component APIs**: Keep prop interfaces consistent where possible
2. **Mobile-First Design**: Adapt layouts for mobile screen constraints
3. **Touch-Friendly Interactions**: Replace hover states with press states
4. **Performance Conscious**: Use FlatList for large datasets, optimize images
5. **Accessibility Focused**: Implement React Native accessibility props
6. **Type Safety**: Maintain strict TypeScript throughout migration

## Build & Development

### Development Workflow

- Expo CLI for development server
- Metro bundler (built into Expo)
- React Native Debugger for debugging
- Expo development build for testing

### Code Quality

- ESLint with Expo config (current setup)
- TypeScript strict mode
- Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for pre-commit hooks (if needed)

### Performance Monitoring

- React Native's built-in performance monitor
- Expo's development tools for bundle analysis
- Custom performance benchmarks for migrated components

This tech stack focuses on leveraging the existing, working architecture while providing clear guidance for the Figma component migration process.
